## How to Contribute

### Working on Issues
Try to avoid working randomly on issues. We request that you work in a systematic manner. If you want to work on an issue, either get the issue assigned to you from the owner/maintainer or ask the development team to assign it to you. If the issue does not exist, open the issue or get it opened.

### Beginner Guidelines

#### Git Guidelines for Beginners

1. **Understand the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with basic Git commands like `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, and `branch`.
2. **Commit Often**: Make small, frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages.
3. **Use Branches**: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This keeps your main branch clean and makes it easier to manage changes.
4. **Pull Regularly**: Regularly pull changes from the main repository to keep your branch up-to-date and avoid conflicts (Important!).
5. **Review Before Committing**: Always review your changes before committing to ensure you are not including unintended modifications.

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Large Commits**: Avoid making large commits with multiple changes. This makes it difficult to review and understand the changes.
2. **Ignoring Merge Conflicts**: Do not ignore merge conflicts. Resolve them carefully to ensure code integrity.
3. **Not Using .gitignore**: Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude files that should not be tracked, such as build files or sensitive information.
4. **Committing Sensitive Information**: Never commit sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
5. **Not Writing Descriptive Commit Messages**: Avoid vague commit messages. Descriptive messages help others understand the purpose of the changes.

By following these guidelines and avoiding common mistakes, you can contribute more effectively to the project.
